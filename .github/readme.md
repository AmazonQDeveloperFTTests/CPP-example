# REPOSITORY MAINTAINER : ![AKSHITA GUPTA](https://github.com/akshitagupta15june)

## Contribute Algorithms & Data Structures: A Collaborative Repository.

## This repository is a collaborative space for students to contribute implementations of algorithms and data structures in different programming languages and contribute to open source.

Contribute to Open Source Algorithms and Data Structures (C++)!
    This repository welcomes your contributions to build a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in C++. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, we have opportunities for you to learn, grow, and make a real impact!


How to get involved:

    Browse open issues: Find an existing issue that interests you and requires help. You can search by difficulty level, language, or algorithm type.
    Create your own issue: Have an idea for a new algorithm or data structure? Submit an issue detailing your proposal and we'll discuss it with you.
    Start contributing: Once you've found an issue, follow these steps:
    Fork the repository: Create a copy of the project on your GitHub account.
    Clone it locally: Download the code to your computer.
    Create a new branch: This isolates your changes from the main project.
    Make your changes: Code the algorithm or data structure following our contribution guidelines (link to guidelines).
    Push your changes: Upload your work back to your forked repository.
    Open a pull request: Submit your changes for review and potential merging into the main project.
    Address feedback: Reviewers might suggest improvements. Make adjustments and update your pull request until it's approved.

Remember:
    Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages describing your changes.
    Feel free to ask questions or seek help if you get stuck. We're here to support you!
